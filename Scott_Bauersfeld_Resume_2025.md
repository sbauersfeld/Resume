## Work Experience
**Databricks – Senior Software Engineer**  
*Feb 2021 – Present*  
- Core engineer for Databricks’ distributed filesystem: enables IDE-like browser development while exposing a POSIX-compliant FS across 1000s of clusters with transparent consistency.  
- **Modernized Workspace Content Platform** onto FS-centric architecture, enabling Git, revision history, search, disaster recovery, and CLI automation for all workspace assets. Reduced integration surface from many-to-many to a single platform; partnered with L6 engineers, mentored teams of 6+, and influenced dozens across org boundaries.  
- **Performance engineering:**  
  - Designed predictive prefetching algorithm to minimize blob-storage latency in non-sequential workloads.  
  - Leveraged Linux kernel features (eBPF, zero-copy paths) to reduce syscalls and memory copies.  
  - Implemented async writes, metadata/data decoupling, caching, and batched APIs.  
  Achieved microsecond-level latency gains where single CLI actions fan out into tens of thousands of FS ops.  
- Built a **distributed garbage collection service** cleaning 100M+ files/week under GDPR constraints.  
- Acted as **core product owner** across unified file editing, import/export APIs, containerization, and reliability. Helped scale adoption from **0 → 10,000+ weekly customers** and **0 → 300,000+ weekly users**.  

**Amazon Web Services – Software Development Intern**  
*Jun 2020 – Sep 2020*  
- Built REST API aggregating 10K logs/sec across 20 AWS regions *(API Gateway, Lambda, CloudFormation, Node.js)*  
- Developed interactive React tool for log visualization.  

**Qualcomm – Software Engineering & ML Intern**  
*Jun 2019 – Sep 2019*  
- Implemented execution provider for ONNX ML models.  
- Quantized DNNs (MobileNet, ResNet) to reduce inference latency by 60× *(C++, Deep Learning)*.
